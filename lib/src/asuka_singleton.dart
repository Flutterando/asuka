/// `showDialog` is originally called from. Use a [StatefulBuilder] or a
/// custom [StatefulWidget] if the dialog needs to update dynamically.
///
/// The `child` argument is deprecated, and should be replaced with `builder`.
///
/// The `context` argument is used to look up the [Navigator] and [Theme] for
/// the dialog. It is only used when the method is called. Its corresponding
/// widget can be safely removed from the tree before the dialog is closed.
///
/// The `barrierDismissible` argument is used to indicate whether tapping on the
/// barrier will dismiss the dialog. It is `true` by default and can not be `null`.
///
/// The `barrierColor` argument is used to specify the color of the modal
/// barrier that darkens everything the dialog. If `null` the default color
/// `Colors.black54` is used.
///
/// The `useSafeArea` argument is used to indicate if the dialog should only
/// display in 'safe' areas of the screen not used by the operating system
/// (see [SafeArea] for more details). It is `true` by default which will mean
/// the dialog will not overlap operating system areas. If it is set to `false`
/// the dialog will only be constrained by the screen size. It can not be 'null`.
//
/// The `useRootNavigator` argument is used to determine whether to push the
/// dialog to the [Navigator] furthest from or nearest to the given `context`.
/// By default, `useRootNavigator` is `true` and the dialog route created by
/// this method is pushed to the root navigator. It can not be `null`.
///
/// The `routeSettings` argument is passed to [showGeneralDialog],
/// see [RouteSettings] for details.
///
/// If the application has multiple [Navigator] objects, it may be necessary to
/// call `Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop(result)` to close the
/// dialog rather than just `Navigator.pop(context, result)`.
///
/// Returns a [Future] that resolves to the value (if any) that was passed to
/// [Navigator.pop] when the dialog was closed.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AlertDialog], for dialogs that have a row of buttons below a body.
///  * [SimpleDialog], which handles the scrolling of the contents and does
///    not show buttons below its body.
///  * [Dialog], on which [SimpleDialog] and [AlertDialog] are based.
///  * [showCupertinoDialog], which displays an iOS-style dialog.
///  * [showGeneralDialog], which allows for customization of the dialog popup.
